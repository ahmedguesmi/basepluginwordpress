Do not edit the CSS files in the directory - they are automatically
generated/compiled with SASS. Doing so may result in your changes being
overwritten.

To make changes to style, modify the appropriate file in the src/scss directory
and Gulp (recommended) or other SASS compiler to generate the CSS file(s).

If you don't want to use Gulp, Koala (http://koala-app.com/) is a good,
cross-platform compiler. Just point it to the src/scss folder, make your
changes to the SCSS file(s), and click compile. It will automatically generate
the CSS file(s) here.

(This only applies if SASS is being used to generate style.)
